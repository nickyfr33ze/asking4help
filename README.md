# Asking for help... the right way ‚≠êÔ∏è
Some ideas that will help those who are looking for help in a community without looking silly ü§™

My best processes and questions to ask:
---
1. Do your own research first. [Google](https://www.google.com) is your best friend. Seriously, use [it](https://www.google.com).
2. Find your happy medium. 
    * What type of content do you intake best from and can retain? 
        * Reading? Watching videos? Listening to audio? 
        * Find what works best for you!
3. Notate your process. **This will be important later**
    * Write down:
        * What you know
        * What you are looking for
        * Where you looked
        * How you looked for "it"
            * What was your Google search?
            * What was your prompt?
        * What did you learn (if anything) from these searches
4. Find the proper channel or outlet to ask your question.
    * Does the channel or outlet have a safe environment to ask the question?
        * Do they encourage learning?
    * Do they have a specfic channel related to your question or topic?

## Creating your ‚ùî
1. Look at your process you notated.
2. Craft your question.
    * Make them concise as possible without glazing over the bullets shown above.
    * Take out filler lanugage like "I just do not know what to do" and "I was hoping..." 
        * You would not be asking the question if you did not know what to do and actively looking for help...
    * 


## Running the script üìú
* The script must be ran with python3. 
    * Anything earlier will not function as intended.

```python
python3 script.py
```

* It's that easy :)
